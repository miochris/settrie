# settrie

Fast subset and superset queries. It implemented Iztok Savnik's proposed data structure [set-trie](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-40511-2_10).

One difference from Iztok Savnik's data structure is, this implementation doesn't memorize a set which ends in a non-leaf node of existing set.
